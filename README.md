## 🚀 Overview

This guide explains how to deploy a **Client-Server Architecture Application**, consisting of:
- A **Server** (API / backend).
- A **Client** (Frontend).

It is designed for deployment on:
- Any **Linux VPS** (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- **AWS EC2**, **DigitalOcean**, **Linode**, or **bare-metal servers**.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- ✅ Node.js >= 16.x installed
- ✅ Git installed
- ✅ SSH access to your server
- ✅ MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or other required databases configured

---

## ⚙️ Build & Deploy Client (Frontend)

1. ✅ Clone the repository to your local machine or server.
2. ✅ Navigate into the `client` folder:

   ```bash
   cd client
````

3. ✅ Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. ✅ Build the optimized production files:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a `/build` folder containing the static production-ready files.

5. ✅ Upload the `/build` folder to your server (or integrate it with your server's static files path).

6. ✅ Start the frontend application in development mode (optional):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   > ⚙️ *In production, the frontend should be served using a static file server like Nginx, or via the backend.*

---

## 📡 Running the Server (Backend)

1. ✅ Clone the repository to your server (or pull changes if already cloned).

2. ✅ Navigate into the `server` folder:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. ✅ Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. ✅ Create your environment variables in a `.env` file for development, or define them securely on your hosting platform for production.

   Example `.env` variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

5. ✅ Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   > ✅ *In production, it is recommended to use a process manager like PM2 to keep the server running continuously.*
